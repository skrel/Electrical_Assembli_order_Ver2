# Description
Components configurator was designed in order to optimize proper offsite assembly and functionality. Divide complex electrical installations into manageable subassemblies that can be prefabricated: electrical boxes for wall roughing, light fixtures, standalone transformer wiring, overhead and underground conduits and a lot more. This tool can help you tie all pre-construction information together throughout the entire project, boost productivity and profitability of design and prefabrication teams.
